      "description": "This is “Aldo”, the main character of the animated short film “Immersive”, in which I held the position of general director during the year that the project lasted. The concept art of the character was done by Diego Delgado, a member of my team. From the concept, I followed the process individually, I started with Zbrush with the blocking, added subdivisions and sculpted until I got a detailed high-polygon model within Zbrush. I proceeded to apply Decimate to simplify the number of polygons and obtain an optimized model to import into Maya. Here I did the retopology together with Zahid Silva, to obtain the lowpoly model of the character. The next thing was to do the UV Mapping, which I also did in Maya and used to texture in Substance Painter, where I did baking to project the detail of the Highpoly to the Lowpoly, obtaining a large amount of detail in a low-polygon model. While I was texturing, Nicole Menor was doing the rig in parallel. Once both processes were finished, I placed the textures on the rigged model, posed the character, and did the lighting and rendering of the images that you can see in this project.",

      "description": "This axe, which I titled ‘Assassin’s Axe’, is a personal project that I carried out from the Concept Art to the final render of the 3D model. For the concept art, I was mainly inspired by the art of Joe Madureira. In addition, I used various axes that I took from Pinterest as a reference. With all this, I started to sketch and paint modifications on Joe’s reference, achieving the concept art that you can see in one of the images uploaded in this project. Then, I proceeded to ‘materialize’ the concept into a Lowpoly model in Autodesk Maya. I also took the opportunity to do the UV Mapping. Immediately afterwards, I took the Lowpoly model to Zbrush, where I sculpted all the detail to obtain the highpoly model. Then, I used this model to do baking and texturing in Substance Painter. Once textured, I imported the Texture Maps to the Model in Maya, added lights, and did the render.",

The models were then baked and textured in Substance Painter. Textures were tested in Marmoset Toolbag, where render passes were also created. Camera and perspective details were imported from Fspy to Maya using a plugin, ensuring consistency with Marmoset settings. Thematic lighting was then applied in Maya and the final render was done with Arnold. Model inspired by the concept of Unknown.",
